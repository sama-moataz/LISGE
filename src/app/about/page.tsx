          <p>
            Hello! I'm the founder of LISGE (Local and International Scholars' Guide to Excellence), and my journey has been one of dedication, learning, and a desire to give back. Growing up in Giza, Egypt, I always strived for excellence, both academically and in my extracurricular pursuits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Academically, I have consistently been a top student, driven by a thirst for knowledge and a passion for challenging myself. This drive led me to participate in programs like DECI (Distinguished Egyptian Cambridge Innovators), where I reached Level 2, honing my critical thinking and innovation skills. I also had the privilege of attending the KOSEN Summer Seminar in Japan, an experience that broadened my horizons and exposed me to different educational approaches and cultures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond academics, I was a dedicated volleyball player for Al Ahly Sporting Club, one of Egypt's most prestigious sports clubs. This experience taught me the importance of discipline, teamwork, resilience, and leadership â€“ qualities that are invaluable in any field.
          </p>
          <p>
            My motivation for creating LISGE stems from my own experiences. I understand the challenges and opportunities that young students in Egypt face. I believe that with the right information and guidance, every student can achieve their dreams of leadership, secure international scholarships, and gain enriching global experiences. LISGE is my way of sharing what I've learned and creating a supportive community for ambitious students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thank you for visiting, and I hope LISGE becomes a valuable resource on your journey!
